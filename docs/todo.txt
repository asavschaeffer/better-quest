# issues

lets make the player title dynamic. lets add word for every combo of stats. to keep it simple, lets calculate the average value for all users, and then use that for the user's highest stat or stat pairs. i.e. a user with 20 str, and 5 everything else would be calculated as a strongman(below average) so we can have a qualifier for that on a scale of it's relationship to the average. right now we only have sample leaderboard people but i think the math should still be able to work all the same. we could even make llm calls to come up with cool names based on player stats / global stats and a list of their latest/favorite quests.

## library

library sortable by stats idk if its the wheel or just simply selecting a stat. start with a few basic quests for each stat. users can fork quests to add specifics and their own details. this means the basic quests need to be comprehensive enough to easily serve a wide variety of specific subquests. each stat has a description page with some admirable people who are high rank and a descriptor of what the stat truly means. we can also use this as a quest advancement idea to lead into the journeys described below

### strength
	that which requires great force to do. included, therefore, is mental strength. that which is genuinely hard to do

### dexterity
	that which requires great expertise to do. technical, fine skills. attention to detail

### stamina
	sustained unrelenting struggle over time

### intelligence
	thinking hard

### spirit
	not thinking. feeling. the godliness inbetween the moments of suffering

### charisma
