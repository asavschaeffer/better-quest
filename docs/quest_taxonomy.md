## Universal / Meta Quests

These don't map to a single stat but are useful utilities:

| Verb          | Example                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

| **organize**  | clean room, declutter, organize workspace           |
| **prepare**   | prep meals, set out clothes, pack bag               |
| **maintain**  | daily routine, habit stack, morning ritual          |
| **explore**   | try something new, explore neighborhood, experiment |
| **celebrate** | reward yourself, acknowledge win, rest after streak |

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Two-Level Hierarchy (for now)

We're locking to **verb → leaf** (2 levels) until the core picker UX is validated.

```
study (family) → study biology (leaf) → BEGIN
```

NOT:

```
study (family) → biology (family) → flashcards (leaf)
```

**Rationale**: The 3rd level (method variants like flashcards/practice questions) adds complexity without much UX gain until users are hitting that ceiling. We can add depth later for high-frequency verbs like `study` and `practice` once the core loop is proven.

**Future expansion**: When ready, prioritize 3rd level for: `study`, `practice`, `train`, `meditate`.

---

### Decision 2: Hybrids Surface via Ranking, Not Cross-Listing

Hybrid quests (e.g., `teach-back session` which is INT+CHA) have **one canonical parent** in the hierarchy. They surface in other contexts via stat-based ranking, not by being listed under multiple families.

```
teach-back session
  parent: "study"           // canonical home
  tags: ["teach", "social"] // for SEARCH discovery only
  statAffinity: { INT: 0.7, CHA: 0.6 }
```

**How it works**:

- User scopes to `study/*`, has INT+CHA set → `teach-back session` rises in ranking
- User searches "teach" → finds it via tags
- User scopes to `teach/*` → does NOT see it (it's not a child of teach)

**Rationale**: Keeps data model simple (one parent per quest). Avoids maintenance headache of "which families should this live in?" Stat weights handle the surfacing naturally.

---

### Decision 3: Families Are Startable (No Separate Generic Leaf)

Every family can be started directly as a generic quest. We do NOT need separate entries for `study (family)` and `study (10 min) (leaf)`.

```
Quest {
  id: "study"
  name: "Study"
  isFamily: true
  isStartable: true        // families can also be started!
  defaultDuration: 10      // when started as generic
  parent: null
  ...
}
```

**UX behavior**:

- **Tap** `study` → scope changes to `study/*`, see children
- **Begin** on `study` → starts "Study (10 min)" generic quest

**Rationale**: Cleaner data model. One entry per concept. The `isStartable` flag on families handles the "quick start" case.

---

## Taxonomy Structure

### Schema

```
Quest {
  id: string
  name: string
  verb: string                // core action (for grouping)

  // Hierarchy
  isFamily: boolean           // true = tappable to change scope
  isStartable: boolean        // true = can hit Begin (families can be both!)
  parent: string | null       // single canonical parent
  tags: string[]              // for search discovery (NOT hierarchy)

  // Ranking signals
  statAffinity: {
    INT: 0-1,
    DEX: 0-1,
    VIT: 0-1,
    SPI: 0-1,
    CHA: 0-1,
    STR: 0-1
  }
  contextSignals: string[]    // e.g., ["morning", "low-energy", "social"]

  // Quest properties
  defaultDuration: number     // minutes
  isGlobal: boolean           // community quest pool
}
```

#### Current Codebase Field Mapping (Better Quest v1)

The mobile app currently uses slightly different field names / ranges:

```
QuestTemplate {
  id: string
  label: string                      // == name
  description?: string

  verb?: string
  parentId?: string | null           // == parent
  isFamily?: boolean
  isStartable?: boolean

  // 0-2 points per stat (not 0-1)
  stats?: { STR|DEX|STA|INT|SPI|CHA|VIT: 0-2 }

  // Search discovery: we currently support BOTH of these:
  keywords?: string[]                // legacy name used across the app
  tags?: string[]                    // newer alias (same purpose)

  defaultDurationMinutes?: number    // == defaultDuration
}
```

If/when we fully standardize naming, we can migrate `label → name`, `parentId → parent`,
and either keep `keywords` only or rename to `tags` everywhere.

### Hierarchy Example

```
study (isFamily: true, isStartable: true, INT: 1.0)
├── study math (isFamily: false, isStartable: true, INT: 1.0)
├── study biology (isFamily: false, isStartable: true, INT: 1.0)
├── study communications (isFamily: false, isStartable: true, INT: 0.7, CHA: 0.5)
└── study something new (isFamily: false, isStartable: true, INT: 0.8, tags: ["novelty"])
```

### Ranking Factors

1. **Stat vector alignment** — user's current stat selection
2. **User history** — frequency, recency of similar quests
3. **Active campaigns/goals** — if "Biology Campaign" is active, boost bio quests
4. **Time of day** — morning → review, evening → reflect
5. **Available time** — 5 min vs 30 min
6. **Variety/novelty** — don't repeat same quest forever
7. **Streak protection** — surface quests that maintain active streaks

### Text Search Behavior

| Query Confidence       | Behavior                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Weak (e.g., "st")      | Text **boosts** but doesn't hard-filter. Show `study`, `stretch`, `sit in stillness` |
| Strong (e.g., "study") | **Hard-scope** to `study/*` family                                                   |

Search matches against: `name/label`, `description`, `verb`, `tags/keywords`

---

## Open Questions (Deferred)

1. **Global quest pool** — how do users discover/fork community quests?
2. **Custom verbs** — can users create their own verbs or only extend existing families?
3. **Stat weights** — are these author-defined or learned from user behavior?
4. **3rd level depth** — when do we add method variants (flashcards, practice questions)?
